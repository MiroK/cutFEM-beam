# How to do things in Git
## 'Making current branch master'
git checkout better_branch
git merge --strategy=ours master    # keep the content of this branch, but record a merge
git checkout master
git merge better_branch             # fast-forward master up to the merge

## Renaming local and remote branches
#rename local branch
git branch -m old-branch-name new-branch-name

#delete remote branch with old name
# origin is the name of remote branch
git push origin :old-branch-name

#create remote renamed branch and setup remote branch tracking (-u flag)
git push -u origin new-branch-name
