1. Need 2d solution for shen biharmonic problem
[OKAY]

2. Test 2d biharmonic
[OKAY]

3a. Text for appendix part, outline
3b. Code for appendix
3c. Finish appendix

4. Consider why shen vs eigen convergence just for Poisson

5. Outlitline of complere report with observation for plate-beam(like) problems

6a. Read on SVD
6b. Read on the continuous trace operator[properties, sur, inj, ...,],
    in general - how do props of operators translate to matrices (svds, eigs)
6c. Read Kent's preconditioning survey

7. It would be nice to have basis of Leg polynomials for u, u`` bcs

8. For Poisson physics consider the plate-beam coupling in FEniCS

9. If the beam were curved what is the governing Poisson equation?

10. Mikael NS solver with 2-periodic and 1-nonperiodic direction resolved by
    Legendre polynomials
